# HTML Presenter
### Under Development
##### Inviting Contributors

A HTML Content Presenter - Making a more visually appealing UI for HTML Content apt for teaching.

### Features
- Displays A Slide Like View (need't have the contents in a box).
- The Topic and SubTopic on screen is indicated on a (sticky?) bar preferably placed on top.
- Images when clicked are expanded to fill the screen (modal?).
- 

### Assumptions
- The topics are arranged in the natural order H1, H2, .... H6
- We're expecting to only pick H1,H2,H3 to be mentioned in the sticky nav bar.
- On Scrolling through the Content, the Title and Sub Title should be updated (if possible add some animation).


### (Feature Requests) 
- Draw Anywhere board : To be able to use the drawing board anywhere during the slideshow and collapse it when not needed. 
- Add a P2P link to use alternative devices to draw on screen like [Board-IO](https://github.com/elvistony/board-io)


Happy Coding!
